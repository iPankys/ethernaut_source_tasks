// In solidity, for a contract to be able to receive ether,
//  the fallback function must be marked payable.


// However, there is no way to stop an attacker from sending ether
//  to a contract by self destroying. Hence, it is important not to count on the invariant address(this).balance == 0 for any contract logic.
